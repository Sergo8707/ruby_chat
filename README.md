## Description 
We have server that receives the client connections and stores them in data dictionaries. These dictionaries 
will keep track of what room the client is located in, receive messages, and relay the messages to other users. 
Each user has a different username, which is the primary key to look up the connections in the data 
dictionary, so that it was possible to keep track of connected users.

##Installation
- to run server in the console by `ruby server.rb` command  
- to run a client in the console by `ruby client.rb` command
- to indicate the client's name
- to use the programme (chatting)
